"It is not the consciousness of men that determines their being, but on the contrary their social being that determines their consciousness." Good evening fellow toastmasters and guests, what I just said was a quote from Karl Marx, a reknowned philosopher. I used to believe that shyness and timidity are parts of my identity. However that idea was challenged recently by a myriad of profound speeches that I have heard this couple of weeks. One speech that caught my mind was Muad's speech on overcoming fear, anxiety, and himself. Such conditions that have been holding me back, so that inspired me a lot. I remembered giving my first table topic and the mere thought of impromptu speaking had given me a gut-wrenching feeling, but I swore to do it even I had to go last. I had hoped that confidence was built into me, and I saw an opportunity to do so when I did my first grammarian role in Monash TMC. Over there, I learnt that public speaking is more than an act of building confidence; but an act of delivering thoughts in a systematic way. Such insightful remark had me reflecting. Referring back to my quote, I am here with a purpose that is to challenge my own thoughts, beliefs, and ideas that they are not deterministic, and that I am certainly not conditioned to be what I am today.
